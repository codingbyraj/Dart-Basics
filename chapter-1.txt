Dart is an open-source general-purpose programming language. 
It is originally developed by Google and later approved as a standard by ECMA.

Dart compiler is Dart VM.
The Dart SDK includes a utility "dart2js", which is a transpiler that generates JavaScript equivalent of a Dart Script.

Run dart code via the Terminal
To execute a Dart program via the terminal:
    - Navigate to the path of the current project
    - Type the following command in the Terminal window
        dart file_name.dart


Enabling Checked Mode
Dart programs run in two modes:−
    - Checked Mode
    - Production Mode (Default)
    It is recommended to run the Dart VM in checked mode during development and testing, since it helps warnings and errors to 
    aid development and debugging process. 
    The checked mode enforces various checks like type-checking etc. 
    To turn on the checked mode, add the -c or –-checked option before the script-file name while running the script.

    However, to ensure performance benefit while running the script, it is recommended to run the script in the production mode.
    for example, Test.dart script file −

 
    void main() { 
        int n = "hello"; 
        print(n); 
    } 
    Run the script by entering:-

    dart Test.dart
    Though there is a type-mismatch the script executes successfully as the checked mode is turned off.
    The script will result in the following output −
        output:- hello

    Now, if we try executing the script with the "- - checked" or the "-c" option −

    dart -c Test.dart or, dart - - checked Test.dart
    The Dart VM will throw an error stating that there is a type mismatch.



class in Dart:
class TestClass {   
   void disp() {     
      print("Hello World"); 
   } 
}  
void main() {   
   TestClass c = new TestClass();   
   c.disp();  
}
